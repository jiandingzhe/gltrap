Uniform index and location are different things: index is used to fetch uniform meta data, and location is used to set uniform value using glUniformXX() calls.

This is wrong:

    int uni_idx = 0;
    glGetActiveUniform(program, uni_idx, ...lots of arguments...);
    ......
    glUniform1i(uni_idx, value);
    
This is correct:
    
    int uni_idx = 0;
    char uni_name[256];
    ...lots of arguments...
    glGetActiveUniform(program, uni_idx, ...lots of arguments..., uni_name);
    GLint uni_loc = glGetUniformLocation(m_program, uni_name);
    ......
    glUniform1i(uni_loc, value);

However, they are identical in some MESA drivers, and misuse would work silently.
